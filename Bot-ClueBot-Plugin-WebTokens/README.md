# NAME

Bot::ClueBot::Plugin::WebTokens - ClueBot plugin that provides JSON Web Tokens to users

# VERSION

Version 0.02

# SYNOPSIS

This plugin is mostly used by other plugins that need to grant access to users through other
(eg. non-xmpp) channels.

```
<user> web_token
<cluebot> Your new token is: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJyb3ZpYm90IiwiYXVkIjoicXVpbUByb3ZpcmEuY2F0IiwiZXhwIjoxNDUwOTA3MzY3fQ.tVvROvXovI9JnWWBJakHIwzJw2z8ZZO5VNLlz622DAU
```

You can use these tokens along with your full username (eg. _user@domain_) to authenticate
on HTTP or WebSocket connections.

The tokens issues to users are valid only for a limited time, and the secret keys used by the
bot are cycled automatically after some time as well.

# OPTIONS

- token\_expiration

    How long should the issued user tokens last.

- secret\_rotation

    How often are new secrets generated by the bot.

- secret\_expiration

    How long will old secrets be kept around. Once they are forgotten, any tokens issued
    to users can't be recognized anymore.

# COMMANDS

- web\_token

    Issues a new JWT token to the user.

    The reply will always be through a private channel.
